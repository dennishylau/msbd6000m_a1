## Assignment Question

Consider the discrete-time asset allocation example in section 8.4 of Rao and Jelvis.  Suppose the single-time-step return of the risky asset as Y_t=a, prob = p, and b, prob = (1 - p). Suppose that T=10, use the TD method to find the Q function, and hence the optimal strategy.
